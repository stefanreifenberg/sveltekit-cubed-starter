# Sveltekit [svelte-cubed](https://svelte-cubed.vercel.app/) starter template

I have been tinkering with svelte-cubed and found myself wanting to create a starter template for my projects. This template is a simple Svelte app that uses the [svelte-cubed](https://svelte-cubed.vercel.app/) framework to create a simple Three.js scene.

Here is a screenshot of the app:

## Getting started

Clone this repo and cd into the directory. After that install the dependencies with `npm install`. Then run `npm run dev` to start the development server.

```bash
# create a new project in the current directory
npm install 

# create a new project in my-app
npm run dev
```
Have fun!
